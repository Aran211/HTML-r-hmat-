<p>Computer programs (or software) are what makes computers work. Without software, modern computers are just complicated machines for turning electricity into heat. It’s software on your computer that runs your operating system, browser, email, games, movie player – just about everything. Unfortunately, computers don’t understand languages like English or Spanish, so we have to use a programming language they understand to give them instructions.

 

    There are many different programming languages, all of which have their own merits, and certain languages are better suited to particular types of tasks, but there is no one language that is the ‘best’.
    
     
    
    In this course, you will be programming using a language called Python. Python is one of a group of languages called “general-purpose programming languages”, which can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Other popular languages in this category are C, Ruby, Java and BASIC.
    
     
    
    This is a small Python program that asks the user to enter their name and says “Hi” to them:
    
     
    
    print("Hello and welcome.")
    name = input("Whats your name?")
    if name == "Martin":
     print("Thats my name too!")
    print("Hi " + name)
    You don’t need to be a computer programmer to be able to read this code. It contains English words and it is readable (if not perhaps understandable). However, by the end of this course you will understand this code, what it does, and the concepts it uses.
    
    Programs are often referred to as code and hence programming is also known as coding.</p>
